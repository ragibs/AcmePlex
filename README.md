## Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a Movie Theater Ticket Reservation application for a fictional company, **AcmePlex**. The system enables customers to search for movies, select showtimes, choose seats, and make payments for tickets. The application distinguishes between two types of users: ordinary users and registered users, offering additional benefits to registered users, such as fee exemptions and early access to ticket bookings.

This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in software design and development, applying systematic design methodologies and implementing best practices in modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## System Design

The system follows a multi-layered architecture with a strong focus on modularity and scalability. Key components include:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles the user interface, including forms for user interaction, seat selection visuals, and confirmation dialogs.
- **Domain Layer**: Manages core business logic, such as user roles, payment processing, ticketing, and cancellation policies.
- **Data Layer**: Interacts with the MySQL database to store user information, movie details, seat availability, and booking records.

### Key Diagrams

- **Activity Diagrams**: Showcase the steps for browsing, booking, and payment processes.
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Represent user interactions with the system's core functionalities.
- **Class Diagrams**: Define the system's classes, attributes, behaviors, and relationships.
- **State Transition Diagrams**: Illustrate states for objects like `Ticket` and `Payment`.
- **Package Diagram**: Details the interactions between presentation, domain, and data layers.
- **Deployment Diagram**: Shows the system's architecture, including client, server, and database interactions.
